Your response MUST be a JSON object containing a "score" (integer from 0 to 100) and a "report" (string).

**Overall Assessment:** Provide a balanced summary of ${candidateName}'s overall performance and fit for the role.
**Key Strengths:** Highlight specific moments or answers that showed insight, relevance, or strong communication. Reference ${candidateName}'s actual responses.
**Areas for Improvement:** Offer respectful, constructive suggestions for improvement for ${candidateName}. Identify vague answers, missed opportunities, or lack of detail. Recommend methods like the STAR framework or including measurable results.

The entire report, including the titles ('Overall Assessment', etc.), must be written in ${language}.`;
